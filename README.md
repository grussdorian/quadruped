## Parts sourcing.

Please refer to [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AzzCM8UDrbhDfgtIsiQplI5SMlo7OLG8/edit#gid=1202520655). Part sourcing is listed here comprehensively.

For building the qudruped's body and legs, we have used 5mm fibre sheets. Ideally it should be carbon fibre. But we could not find a vendor who could cut the carbon fibre sheets according to our specifications. Also laser cutting of carbon fibre is not possible in the lab. The next best choice was to use acrylic fibre and that is what we used. $3$ mm thickness for legs and $5$ mm thickness for the base and top.

All the strucural elements are taken from [here](https://a360.co/2TEh4gQ)
